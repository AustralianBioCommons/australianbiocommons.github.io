title: "Featured tools & workflows"
---

A list of public repositories on the [Australian BioCommons GitHub](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons), that contain documentation about tool & workflow install, testing and optimisation on [partner infrastructures](./1_compute_systems.html).

-----

-----

# How are the tools and workflows selected?

The list below includes tools identified through consultations with the [BioCommons Communities](https://www.biocommons.org.au/get-involved), as well as active [Bioplatforms Australia Framework Initiatives](https://bioplatforms.com/projects/).

# Tools and workflows

- Software documentation is linked from the *Tool / workflow name* in the first column.
- More information about a tool can be found by following the link in the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) column.
- When a tool has been containerised to for easier installation on any compute infrastructure, a link to the containerised software is shown in the [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/#/) column.

# What do the repositories contain?

Each repository is structured using our [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/releases) (for [Tools](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/docs/tools.md), [Workflows](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/docs/workflows.md) or [Infrastructure](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/docs/infrastructure_optimisation.md)) that have been developed through engagement with community bioinformaticians. Real-world use cases informed iterative development to produce a first version of these guidelines.

We will continue to work together with the community to build a fit-for-purpose and standardised approach for presenting tool and workflow documentation which contains information specific to Australian HPC and Cloud infrastructure. These guidelines and the documentation therein will be developed in line with community requirements, and will align closely to global efforts (e.g. that being undertaken by the [ELIXIR tools platform](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/tools)).
