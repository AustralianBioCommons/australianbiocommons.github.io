## Acknowledgements

The information presented here is part of [collaborative activities](https://www.biocommons.org.au/activities) coordinated by the Australian BioCommons. These activities draw upon the expertise and enthusiasm of the BioCommons partner infrastructures and the Australian bioinformatics community, which includes:

- The BioCommons [communities](https://www.biocommons.org.au/get-involved) (e.g. genome assembly, metabolomics)
- The [Bioplatforms Australia](https://bioplatforms.com/) Framework Initiatives (e.g. [Oz Mammals Genomics](https://ozmammalsgenomics.com/), [Genomics for Australian Plants](https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/))

The website and its contents have been built using [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (dplyr *et al.*), with [references included](5_attributions.html), and additional attributions embedded in the Rmarkdown scripts.
