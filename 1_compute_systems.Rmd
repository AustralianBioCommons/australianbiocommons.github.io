# FAQ: can I get a HPC allocation through the BioCommons?

Allocation of computational resources to individual researchers on partner HPC and cloud infrastructures is through the usual channels offered via each partner (see instructions for each by following these links: [NCI](https://nci.org.au/users/how-access-nci), [Pawsey](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Getting+Access), [QCIF](https://www.qcif.edu.au/services/computing/), [ARDC-Nectar](http://cloud.nectar.org.au/start-now/)). The [BioCommons BioCloud](https://www.biocommons.org.au/biocloud) activity is working with these partners to examine ways to make it easier for life science researchers to receive HPC and HTC allocations.

Note that access to computational resources via the [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au/) hosted web platform is unlimited for Australian researchers thanks to our computational partners (ARDC-Nectar Cloud, University of Queensland, QCIF, University of Melbourne and Pawsey) who underpin the Galaxy Australia service.
