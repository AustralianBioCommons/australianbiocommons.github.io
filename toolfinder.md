==========

## Description

Introduction of tool, including its input(s)/output(s) as well as a list (or link to) of available shell commands (useful when building interfaces/wrappers for containers)

# Diagram

```
Logical visual description of processing steps for workflow
```

# User guide

## Quick start guide

```
General guide for deployment across multiple infrastructures (distinct from specific infrastructure quick start guide) 
```

---

## Infrastructure usage and recommendations

```
+ link to installation instructions for each infrastructure 
+ recommendations
    
Documentation for a specific infrastructure should go into a infrastructure documentation template
https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md
```

## Compute resource usage across tested infrastructures

```
Table with high level compute resource usage information for standalone runs or testing of specific versions on specific computational infrastructures.
```

| Title | Version | Sample description | Wall time | Cores | Peak RAM in GB (requested) | Drive (GB) | HPC-HTC | If HPC-HTC is other, specify | Scheduler | Year-Month |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
|       |         |                    |           |       |                            |            |         |                              |           |            |

# Benchmarking

```
Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure should go here: if this document is complicated it should go into a benchmarking template, or be provided elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo).
